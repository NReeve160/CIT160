        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p> 
        A fully online school that provides quality education to people no matter there 
        circumstances. We have many virtual reality devices which can place people into
        a single server. This could provide people who can't attend school through normal means. 
        If locations, finances, or cost of supplies are a problem then this could
        be a very practical solution.
        </p>

        <h2>Classes</h2>
        <p>Classes will work with a teacher reveiving control of the different VR
            headsets. This wil notify the teacher if the headset is taken off, or if 
            the students are doing anything else on their headsets. It can take place
            in a virtual room that that looks like a traditional classroom, or it could
            take place in a more fantastic location. If a class on history is studying 
            the ancient egyptians it could take place in a simmulation of the angient
            pyrarmids.
